<h3>Hi there ! ðŸ‘‹</h3> 


I'm <a href="https://bab-codes.fr/" target="_blank">Bab</a>, a Full Stack Developer based in France.

I am passionate about creating web applications and seamless user experiences. I love blending different technologies to bring my projects to life, 
and Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work on various initiatives that have allowed me to gain solid expertise.


I am currently immersed in various private projects that will not be made public on GitHub, fueling my passion for development while allowing me to explore the latest technologies.
